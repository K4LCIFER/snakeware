# Summary

The aspiration of this library is to facilitate interfacing with Thinkware dashcams.


## Supported Dashcams

> [!CAUTION]
> This library is under *active* development. Support, behavior, and reliability are not guaranteed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find that particular Thinkware dashcam has not been tested and confirmed functional, it
> doesn't necessarily mean that this library won't work with it â€” there may be some API overlap.

> [!CAUTION]
> There is an increased risk of unexpected behavior and/or damage if the library is used with an
> untested dashcam.

# How You Can Help

## Reverse Engineering

Network captures are an invaluable asset; all the known behvaior has more or less been found by
prodding at the dashcam with various states and observing how it responds. Things like commands and
their responses, errors, unique dashcam features, etc. all need to be observed and analyzed.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is currently unknown if a dashcam can be irreparably bricked if interacted with incorrectly.

## Testing Dashcams

This library can only be reliable for a particular dashcam if it has already been tested on that
particular dashcam. When a dashcam is tested, please report back your results, so that others can
document it. Even if it appears like a dashcam has already been tested, further tests are still
greatly appreciated for confirmation.

> [!CAUTION]
> It's possible that this library may break something.

## Documentation

Documenting commands, responses, errors, associated dashcams that they are known to work
with etc. is the current main focus; however, documenting code is also perfectly fine!

## Reporting Bugs

A bug can only be fixed if it is known. Please report them!

## Suggesting Features

The current scope of feature requests is more centered around requesting a particular dashcam that
is not currently supported and any particular unique behavior that it may have. With that scope in
mind, though, I'm still open to hearing other suggestions!

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull-requests are welcome! Any help is appreciated.
